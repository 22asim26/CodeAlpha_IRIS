# 🌸 CodeAlpha\_Iris\_Classification

## 📌 Project Title

**Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression**

## 📋 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset

* Source: scikit-learn built-in Iris dataset
* Features used:

  * Sepal Length
  * Sepal Width
  * Petal Length
  * Petal Width

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. Load the Iris dataset
2. Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluate the model accuracy and classification report on test data

## ✅ Output

The model achieved high accuracy (\~96-100%) on test data, with detailed classification report showing performance for each species.
